ANY RELATED DOCUMENTATION. BY DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING, YOU (ON BEHALF
OF YOURSELF OR AS AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ON BEHALF OF AN
ENTITY) AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT
REGARDING YOUR USE OF THE DATABASE SOFTWARE AND ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE

1.  NOTICE. This is a legal evaluation license ("Agreement") between you
    ("LICENSEE") and ITTIA L.L.C, a Washington Limited Liability Company
    ("ITTIA"). By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Database
    Software accompanying this Agreement, which includes computer
    software and "online" or electronic documentation, associated media,
    benchmarks, and printed materials, you agree to be bound by the
    terms and conditions of this Agreement. The right to use the
    Database Software is time limited. All rights granted to LICENSEE in
    this Agreement will be void after the end of the evaluation period,
    which is no later than 30 days after LICENSEE received the Database
    Software.

2.  SUBJECT MATTER OF THE LICENSE. This Agreement is a novation of all
    prior agreements, and integration of all proposals and
    representations between ITTIA and LICENSEE, regarding all ITTIA
    software in your possession for evaluation, including the contents
    of any sealed media package(s), earlier releases of the software,
    all accompanying written materials, whether contained in manuals,
    sealed media package(s) or otherwise (hereafter referred to as
    "Database Software").

3.  LICENSE TO EVALUATE. ITTIA grants LICENSEE a limited, non-exclusive,
    nonassignable, nontransferable license to make and use copies of the
    Database Software for the sole purpose of evaluating the Database
    Software. This license offers the right to evaluate the Database
    Software for development of computer programs in compiled, linked,
    executable form ("Product"), provided Product that includes the
    Database Software does not constitute a database management system
    that could be used to commercially compete with the Database
    Software. The evaluation version of the Database Software may be
    limited to one million transactions, three tables, and five indexes
    per database. LICENSEE shall not use the Database Software, or any
    portion thereof, for any production or commercial purpose, only for
    evaluation.

4.  BENCHMARK TESTING. LICENSEE shall not disclose the results of any
    benchmark test of the Database Software to any third party without
    ITTIA's prior written approval.

5.  OTHER RESTRICTIONS. The license(s) granted herein are personal to
    the LICENSEE specified during the evaluation period. The LICENSEE
    may be an individual or organization. The LICENSEE may be a division
    or subsidiary of a larger organization or the affiliate of a smaller
    organization.  Additional licenses for development and distribution
    by the LICENSEE or its affiliates must be separately obtained from
    ITTIA. LICENSEE may not develop (beyond prototypes), use, reproduce,
    modify, distribute, disclose, or transfer the Database Software
    except as allowed by this license Agreement. LICENSEE may not sell,
    sublicense, rent, lease, assign, give, or otherwise transfer any
    part of the Database Software or this license. LICENSEE may not
    retain copies, even of prior versions of the Database Software,
    after the termination of this license. LICENSEE's obligations under
    this Agreement survive any termination of the licenses granted by
    this Agreement. You shall not distribute any software statically or
    dynamically linked with the Database Software.

6.  REVERSE ENGINEERING. As the LICENSEE, you may not reverse engineer,
    disassemble, or decompile the Database Software, or otherwise
    attempt to discover the source code of the Database Software, except
    where expressly permitted by the applicable law to obtain
    compatibility with other software programs, and only after prior
    written notification and approval by ITTIA.

7.  DATABASE SOFTWARE ACCESS. Access to the Database Software shall be
    limited to employees and contractors of LICENSEE who (i) require
    access to the Database Software for the purposes of evaluation and
    (ii) have signed a confidentiality agreement in which such employee
    or contractor agrees to protect third party confidential information
    with terms no less stringent than those set forth in this Agreement.
    LICENSEE agrees that any breach by any employee or contractor of
    such employee's and contractor's obligations under such
    confidentiality agreements shall also constitute a breach by
    LICENSEE hereunder. LICENSEE shall maintain and, upon ITTIA's
    reasonable request, provide to ITTIA, the names of all employees and
    contractors who have had access to the Database Software.

8.  OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The Database Software is
    owned by ITTIA and is protected by national intellectual laws and
    international treaty provisions. The Database Software contains
    proprietary information. Therefore, you must protect the Database
    Software like any other material protected by intellectual property
    laws (such as copyright, patent, and/or trade secret), ensuring that
    anyone with access to the Database Software refrains from
    unauthorized reproduction, use or disclosure. ITTIA retains all
    rights not expressly granted. No title, property rights or copyright
    in the Database Software or in any modifications to the Database
    Software shall pass to the LICENSEE under any circumstances.
    LICENSEE may not remove, obscure or alter any copyright, trademark,
    patent, trade secret, confidential, or other proprietary notices on
    or in the Database Software.

9.  TERMINATION. This license is granted for evaluation purposes only.
    All grants of license herein expire 30 days after receiving the
    Database Software. After this date, you must either purchase the
    software license with the appropriate license agreement or destroy
    all copies of the Database Software and all derivative works. The
    license granted herein may also be terminated by returning or
    destroying all copies of the Database Software materials within your
    control and so notifying ITTIA in writing. The above licenses,
    including your right to use the Database Software, will terminate
    automatically if you infringe ITTIA copyrights or breach this
    Agreement. Termination of your licenses does not affect your
    obligations under this Agreement. ITTIA reserve the right to
    terminate this Agreement with no cause, with 48 hours’notice.

10. EXPORT AND COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND POLICIES. LICENSEE agrees to
    comply with all applicable laws, regulations, rulings, and executive
    orders and any other applicable jurisdictions including but not
    limited to those relating to the export or re-export of the Database
    Software, and with all applicable international laws which must be
    complied with in order to protect or preserve ITTIA's copyright(s),
    trade secrets(s) and other Intellectual Proprietary Rights in and to
    the Database Software.

11. LIMITED WARRANTY. THE DATABASE SOFTWARE, WHEN INCORPORATED INTO THE
    PRODUCT, IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY OTHER WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND.  ITTIA DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE
    GIVEN BY ITTIA, ITS DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS, OR EMPLOYEES
    SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS
    WARRANTY AND THE LICENSEE MAY NOT RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR
    ADVICE.

12. LIMITED LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION. ITTIA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
    ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, COSTS
    OF COVER, OR THE LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
    THE DATABASE SOFTWARE (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT,
    NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE) EVEN IF ITTIA OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE
    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN PARTICULAR, THE
    LICENSEE RECOGNIZES THAT THE DATABASE SOFTWARE MAY BE PART OF A
    SYSTEM USED TO CONTROL EXPENSIVE OR DANGEROUS EQUIPMENT. ITTIA SHALL
    NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR INJURY RESULTING FROM THE OPERATION
    OF SUCH EQUIPMENT. LICENSEE agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
    ITTIA harmless from any claim, lawsuit, legal proceeding,
    settlement, or judgment (including without limitation ITTIA's
    reasonable the United States and local attorneys' and expert
    witnesses' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with the
    copying, marketing, performance or other distribution of the
    Products.  In no event will ITTIA liability arising out of this
    agreement exceed the aggregate amount received by ITTIA from
    LICENSEE under this Agreement.

13. THE LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIMITED LIABILITY SPECIFIED IN THIS
    AGREEMENT ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN
    BETWEEN ITTIA AND THE LICENSEE. ITTIA WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE
    THE DATABASE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.

14. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The parties agree that
    Confidential Information shall mean information covering the
    following: (i) pricing of the Database Software (ii) the Database
    Software, (iii) the technology, ideas, know-how, documentation,
    processes, algorithms, and trade secrets or associated trademarks
    with the Database Software, (iv) the LICENSEE's project and business
    details, disclosed by either of the parties to the other party under
    this Agreement. Both parties agree to maintain Confidential
    Information in confidence by using a reasonable degree of care in
    order to ensure that no unauthorized persons shall have access to
    the Confidential Information. The parties agree that the terms of
    this section shall continue in full force and effect irrespective of
    the expiration or termination of this Agreement for a period of five
    (5) years from the Effective Date (as specified below) of this
    Agreement unless otherwise specified in a future agreement between
    the parties. ITTIA and LICENSEE further agree that each party shall
    protect the existence and terms of this Agreement, including
    information about the evaluation of the Database Software in
    LICENSEE's business and terms around such use, as Confidential
    Information. Confidential Information shall not include that
    information which (i) becomes part of the public domain through no
    breach by any of the parties; (ii) is independently developed
    without the use of Confidential Information; or (iii) is rightfully
    disclosed by a third party.

15. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. ITTIA software and documentation
    are provided with restricted rights. Use, duplication, or disclosure
    by the Government is subject to restrictions.

16. SEVERABILITY. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
    shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be valid and effective
    under applicable law. If any provision is invalid, the remaining
    provisions remain enforceable.

17. EXPORT LICENSES. You agree that You will not export any United
    States source technical data acquired from ITTIA, or the Database
    Software, to any country for which the United States Government or
    any agency, at the time of export, requires an export license or
    other governmental approval without first obtaining the license or
    approval required by applicable United States law.

18. Injunctive Relief. LICENSEE agrees that its breach of this Agreement
    will cause ITTIA irreparable harm for which recovery of monetary
    damages would be inadequate and that ITTIA will therefore be
    entitled to seek timely injunctive relief to protect ITTIA's rights
    in addition to any and all remedies available by law.

19. Export Control. All software and technical information delivered
    under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export controls under the
    Export Administration Regulations (the "EAR") or the International
    Traffic in Arms Regulations (the "ITAR") and may be subject to
    export, re-export, or import regulations in other countries.
    LICENSEE agrees to strictly comply with all such laws and
    regulations. LICENSEE will not export or re-export the software and
    technical information, directly or indirectly, to (1) any countries
    that are subject to US export restrictions (currently including, but
    not necessarily limited to, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and
    Syria); (2) any end-user who LICENSEE knows or has reason to know
    will utilize them in the design, development or production of
    nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or rocket systems, space
    launch vehicles, and sounding rockets, or unmanned air vehicle
    systems; or (3) any end-user who has been prohibited from
    participating in US export transactions by any federal agency of the
    US government.

20. LAW AND JURISDICTION. The governing law for this Agreement is the
    law of California State, the U.S.A. and any disputes which have not
    been capable of resolution by friendly negotiation shall be brought
    before the Federal Courts in Orange County, California State, USA.
    The United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods
    does not apply to this Agreement. Any controversy or claim arising
    out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall
    be settled by binding arbitration in Orange County, California under
    the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
    Association by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with said
    rules. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
    entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, the parties may apply to any court of competent
    jurisdiction for injunctive relief without breach of this
    arbitration provision. If any provision or provisions of this
    Agreement are determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable,
    the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining
    provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or
    impaired thereby. The prevailing party in such proceeding will be
    entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including reasonable
    attorneys' fees.
